# 時空 Blog

A simple light blog built on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

This design was actually made all the way back in early 2008. [The very first version](/resources/old/jikuu-design-v1a.png) was used for a graphic design blog and was originally built in Wordpress. The design was made to be as simple and lightweight as possible so as to not overpower the designs featured in the posts. My friend Yomar Augusto [made a cool logo for it](/resources/yomar-logo.pdf) very shortly after it went live and I've been using it ever since. In 2011 I rebuilt the design into a Tumblr theme and [toyed around with it as image blog](/resources/old/jikuu-design-v1b.png).

So why bring back such an ancient design in 2022? Well, the truth is I've always liked the simplicity of it. To me this was a very interesting time in web design. TODO type some more here.

A few small changes have been made to modernize it just a tiny bit. The blog originally used *Lucida Grande* as typeface, which I thought was underrated back in the day when only a handful of fonts were usable, but today I feel the system font is the better choice. I've also replaced the original pixel based measurements with dpi-aware em units. All text styling has been tightened up.
